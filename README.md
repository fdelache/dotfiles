This is my simple configuration used on my Mac laptop.

## ZSH
I use zsh as my main shell environment.
The configuration has been taken from https://medium.com/@Clovis_app/configuration-of-a-beautiful-efficient-terminal-and-prompt-on-osx-in-7-minutes-827c29391961

## VIM
I use vim as my main editor for development.
Again the configuration has been taken from https://janjiss.com/walkthrough-of-my-vimrc-file-for-ruby-development/
